Project:      BlackjackSimulator
Author:       Conner Hurst

Purpose:      This application simulates a number of heads-up blackjack hands. Its purpose is to allow the user to test different playing
              strategies. By default, the computer will play according to the standard recommended table (shown here: 
              https://www.bestonlinecasino.com/strategies/blackjack/hit-or-stand-chart/). The user can change these settings, let the
              computer play differently, and track the results.
         
Limitations:  Currently, the computer will never split its hand or double down.
